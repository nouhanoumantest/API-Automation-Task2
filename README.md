API Automation Framework - Task 2


Description:
This API automation projects goes through testing API scenarios for notes product.
I have created a maven project and implemented the automation using Rest Assured automation framework.
I have also added negative scenarios to the test class.

Areas to improve:
Due to lack of time I would recommend additional refactoring can be done to the project and reporting can also be added using allure.
